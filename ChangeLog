	dogtail 0.9.9
	=============
	A 1.0 pre-release. Contains a big number of fixes and changes done
	since 0.9.0. Most important of these is framework's compatibility with
	Python3. We've modified the code everywhere to run with both Python 2.7
	and 3.3+. This means that from now on we maintain the same codebase and
	are releasing the same tarball, which can be used to package both py2 and
	py3 installations downstream. A complete list of fixes and changes will
	be present here, when we release 1.0 after 0.9.9 has been thouroughly tested.

	Though considered a pre-release, don'worry! 0.9.9 is considered stable and
	have gone through some rigorious testing already. Thanks to newly extended
	unit-test-set, it is actually the most self-tested release so far.

	dogtail 0.9.0
	=============
	Over the last year we've made a good number of fixes, added some new features
	and got overall stability to the point where we can make a new 'major minor'
	release. With 0.9 we're finally getting only a step away from what we'd like
	to get done with 1.0.


	 * Added a fix for situations when a previously crashed application
	   still registered with at-spi blocks search ('Broken' session problem)
	   Fixed for root.application(), root.applications() and for whenever
	   GeneralPredicate is used (.child()). Also done for Sniff. RHBZ 972257

	 * Added a support for gnome-continuous build-api (#36)

	 * Added a direct lambda support in the findChildren method, that allows
	   using non-predicate lambdas to create search properties. These can be
	   all pure dogtail Node properties (i.e. showing), not limiting to just
	   pyatspi ones as is when using Predicate.

	 * Added a GnomeShell 'helper' class into utils module allowing to work
	   with the new top-panel application menu.

	 * With GTK3.10+ Gdk changes, needed to tune the keyNameToKeyCode function
	   so that it provides valid keySym in as many cases possible - with both
	   pre-GTK3.10 as well as GTK3.11+ having the same behavior in typeText and
	   pressKey

	 * Sniff ui update: the info pane now stays down on resizing

	 * Got rid of some deprecated GObject calls

	 * Several updates to the dogtail-run-headless-next
	    - Any kind of session can now be used in any combination with both gdm/kdm
	      --session can be used to specify any xsession desktop file, 'kde' defaults
	        to 'kde-plasma' too keep pre-updated compatibility; default is now the previous user session
	      --dm - new param to pick either gdm (default) or kdm
	      --session-binary - new param to specify any in-session binary to grab script env from
	                       - to be used with non gnome/kde session (lxde, ubuntu)
	                       - do not confuse with session execs like gnome-session and starkde, that may
	                         actually exit after session loadup; it should be everpresent (kwin, shell...)
	    - Added a --restart switch to force restart the previously running (often left-over) session before proceeding
	    - More logging of script execution (start/stop/PID), and some cleanups

	 * Trap GErrors in findAllDescendants and retry if it occurs: This fixes crashes in findChildren if elements are being added/removed quickly

	 * Unicode handling updates:
	    - Make sure safeDecode is not skipping any strings
	    - Don't crash when logging message contains unicode

	 * Error Handling for Attribute Error

	 * Fixed utils.run issue when having whitespace containing binary by
	   using shlex shell-like parsing split.

	 * Removed an always true if condition in i18n

	 * Log child description when clicking. The log will now print the element description when it will be clicked

	 * Trap TypeError in findAllDescendants: Sometimes pytaspi returns None as a Node if children are being removed too fast.
	   We should retry search in this case

	 * Extended the default TypingDelay from 0.075 to 0.1 seconds (helps working with certain high unicode charactes)

	 * Fixed an bug in sniff discovered by jmolet that made sniff crash when
	   run from /bin/sniff not /usr/bin/sniff

	 * Generate a better script method call for labels

	 * Fix for failing 'focus.application.node' seting

	 * Derive all classes from object explicitely

	 * Changed icons used in sniff that got moved to the gnome-icon-theme-legacy
	   recently for the ones from non-legacy package.

	 * Unified the 'isSth' vs. 'sth' properties for only 'sth' - added 'selected', but also introduced
	   'isChecked' property for 0.7.x compatibility

	 * Added instructions on how to enable accessibility into utils.bailBecauseA11yIsDisabled()

	 * Added a 'retry' option to the tree.root.application()

	 * Fixed the concurrent creation of sniff_refresh lock from both tree and procedural

	 * Switched to use environ value to get user in config. os.getlogin breaks when run scheduled from a testing system with no terminal.

	 * Patched the mouse related rawinput methods to prevent using negative coordinates

	 * Updated and added more unittests

2013-07-09 Vita Humpa <vhumpa@redhat.com>

	dogtail 0.8.2
	=============
	Second update to the 0.8 series containing several fixes and improvements

	 * Added the dogtail-run-headless-next to replace the dogtail-run-headless in future.
	  -next, uses a diplay manager (kdm or gdm) for session management, should be used instead of older
	  headless on systemd systems already

	 * Unittests vastly improved and updated

	 * Fixed a missing reset of FocusWindow to None on application refocus

	 * Fixed the dogtail-logout to use gnome-shell instead of old gnome-panel

2012-09-07 Vita Humpa <vhumpa@redhat.com>

    dogtail 0.8.1
    =============
	A first update to the new GNOME3 / KDE4 compatible release containing several fixes:

	* Sniff's autorefresh made togglable, to help avoid collisions with potential
	  running dogtail scripts. Sniff checks at startup whether some script is running
	  and sets up the autorefresh off if it is.

	* Added a locking mechanism into utils that can be used to solve situations when
	  multiple dogtail processes/thread are running (applied in tree/procedural and sniff
	  already)

	* Removed the deprecated dependency on CORBA

	* Icons no longer use absolute pathing in sniff (thx roignac)

	* Deprecated  .has_key() operator replaced with 'in'.

	* Removed .svg inside sniff's .desktop file


2012-05-30 Vita Humpa <vhumpa@redhat.com>

	dogtail 0.8.0
	=============
	Finally a big release updating dogtail after more than 2 years ! Dogtail
	is developed and maintained now again.

	Simply put, ported to be compatible with the new GNOME 3 and to work well in major
	GNOME 3 (GTK3) distributions.

	We'd like to make the 0.8.x version onward the GNOME 3 compatible branch usable
	for Fedora, RHEL7 and others, while keeping 0.7.x releases for fixes in older GNOME2
	systems.

	--- What was done ---

	Notably, Sniff's UI needed to ported completely to GTK3, yet there are
	also several places in dogtail 'itself' that needed to be rewritten to go ahead
	with the new technologies. Those were all the modules where the old pygtk was
	used for various reasons (rawinput, utils, tree...). Incompatibilites were also
	present due to the new version of pyatspi (notably with the doAction method).

	Release highlights:

	* A great number of fixes everywhere related to GTK/GNOME/At-Spi updates

	* The dogtail-recorder was dropped for now, but might return in RC or 0.8.1

	* Thanks to the qt-at-spi project, dogtail now works out-of-the-box for QT!

	* Headless supports KDE sessions

	* Headless working with full 3D-Accelerated GNOME session (no fallback anymore)

	* Highlight used in sniff completely re-written and made toggleable (of by default)

	* Makefile updated, 'make run' builds packages in homedir/rpmbuld now

	* Several examples fixed for updated gedit

	* Added tree.isChild() convenience method

	* Renamed doAction to doActionNamed due to conflict with doAction inside pyatspi namespace

	* Delay made configurable in absoluteMotion and relativeMotion functions

	* Changed at-spi activation to use DConf instead of GConf

	* A bit of code clean-up and modernization (using @property now etc.)

2009-12-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Add a little more error checking to avoid some cases
	where sniff, if left running for long periods of time, would crash.

2009-10-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Add tests for getting labeler/labelee.

2009-10-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Refactor all Node properties, to clean up namespace
	pollution.

2009-10-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Rewrite the Node.value property in a way that's
	compatible with python 2.4 while still avoiding namespace pollution.
	Add docstrings for the AccessibleValue-related properties.

2009-10-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Rewrite Node.findChildren() using
	pyatspi.utils.findAllDescendants(). It's around 10% faster now and
	allows you to use any kind of predicate you wish.

	* tests/Node.py: Make one of the Node.findChildren() tests use
	non-recursive mode.

2009-10-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Add another unit test for Node.findChildren(). Add
	docs for the rest.

2009-10-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Add several unit tests for AccessibleValue-related
	properties, since they were all broken a long time ago without anyone
	noticing.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix all the AccessibleValue-related properties.

2009-10-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Add another unit test for Node.findChildren().

2009-10-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Add unit test for Node.findChildren(), since I'm
	going to rewrite it using the more-optimized
	pyatspi.utils.findAllDescendants().

2009-10-20  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/procedural.py: Add more tests, make miscellaneous tweaks.

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Fix a bug found by unit tests.

2009-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/procedural.py: Add some unit tests for the procedural
	interface.

2009-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Add tests for Node.caretOffset and Node.combovalue;
	minor tweaks to other tests.

2009-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, dogtail/__init__.py: Post-release version bump.

2009-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, dogtail/__init__.py: Bump version to 0.7.0. Remove
	references to .svn directory. Reflect new site.

2009-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS, README: Add notes about API docs.

2009-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update.

2009-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Remove tests for Node.version. This actually comes
	straight from pyatspi, and is just plain not useful. It is also
	inconsistent. For example, on RHEL5 it gives you the gail version,
	while on Fedora 12 it gives you the gtk2 version.

2009-10-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/__init__.py: Don't import pyatspi so early.

2009-10-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Make sure that binaries (at least those with
	absolute or relative paths specified) exist and are executable long
	before we try to execute them.

2009-10-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Catch LookupErrors (e.g. quitting an app)

2009-09-30  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Disable debug logging... again.

2009-09-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Remove an unused set object. Trying to stay compatible
	with older pythons...

2009-09-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add Node.contains(), which can be used to determine
	if a given point onscreen lies inside a Node's extents. Also add
	Node.getAccessibleAtPoint(), which tries to find the Node at a given
	point on screen.

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Use the new Node methods to reimplement
	most of the click detection; the old method was too expensive and
	fragile. Also turn on pyatspi's caching.

2009-09-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add FocusWindow class, and corresponding
	focus.window() API. I think eventually I want focus.window() calls to
	raise the window to the foreground.

2009-09-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix a bug in Node.typetext(). Actually, change its
	behavior significantly: if we can't grab keyboard focus, fall back to
	inserting text via the editabletext interface at the current caret
	location. old behavior was to replace contents entirely, which doesn't
	scale at all.

2009-09-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Use specific Predicate subclasses where
	available.

2009-09-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Keyboard recording had been disabled by
	accident. Reenable it.

2009-09-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Simplify Node.click(); add Node.doubleClick().

	* tests/Node.py: Make GtkDemoTest.runDemo() use Node.doubleClick()
	instead of the activate action, since gtk-demo doesn't appear to use
	that action anymore. This will be backward-compatible anyway.

2009-09-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Look for at-spi instead of gail in testGetVersion
	since Fedora no longer has a package called gail.

2009-09-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* INSTALL: Update.

2009-09-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* README: Update.

2009-09-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py, dogtail/tree.py: Fix some formatting that epydoc
	doesn't like.

2009-09-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update.

2009-08-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Tweak usage output.

2009-08-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Require a script argument to be run!

2009-08-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Refactor eventlistener (de)registration
	code. Also move some logEvent calls.

2009-07-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/test-events.py: Update to pyatspi. Disable some events as
	they just flood the terminal.

2009-05-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-logout: Work with RHEL5.

2009-05-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Use os.kill() instead of Popen.terminate(),
	since the latter doesn't exist before python 2.6...

2009-05-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Oops, don't close() the xinitrc object!

2009-05-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Let scratch files be deleted upon closing. Keep
	Session.xinitrcFileOBj around until its start() method is next called,
	so it can be read in the meantime.

2009-05-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-logout: Don't use raw clicks. Also add a little more
	documentation.

2009-05-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Fix path to dogtail-logout

2009-05-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

2009-05-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Make scriptCmdList an optional argument to
	Session.init()

2009-05-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Fix option application.

2009-05-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Tweak the way we find the correct environment
	for the script.

2009-05-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py, scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Refactor most of
	dogtail.sessions.

2009-04-30  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Merge Session and GNOMESession; refactor
	Session; add Script.

2009-04-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-logout: Add a note about the script still "working"
	if gnome-session doesn't end up being accessible.

2009-04-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Give a choice of X servers.

2009-04-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-logout: Add a sleep(1), something's wrong...

2009-04-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Actually instantiate the session
	object.

2009-04-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Properly report exit code.

2009-04-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Draft of a rewrite using
	dogtail.sessions

2009-04-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-logout: Add a new script, dogtail-logout. This is
	for use with headless sessions. Currently doesn't work yet.

2009-04-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/sessions.py: Add a sessions module. This will become the
	basis for a rewritten dogtail-run-headless.

2009-03-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* epydoc.conf: Add the Epydoc config file.

2009-03-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* Makefile: Add proper targets for generating/uploading API docs.
	We're using Epydoc now.

2009-03-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: If we're running under pydoc or epydoc, don't bail
	if accessibility is disabled.

2008-12-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/appstartup.py: Add a new example that launches a given
	application, then checks to see that it started correctly by looking
	for a Node with the given roleName.

2008-08-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Actually, handle the
	file chooser's expander widget more gracefully by looking to see if it
	has the 'checked' state before expanding it - apparently 'checked'
	means it is expanded. Go figure.

2008-08-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Make Click.__call__() work without arguments
	again.

2008-08-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Don't import pyatspi unnecessarily.

2008-08-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Use config.actionDelay for click().

2008-08-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Collapse the file
	chooser's expander widget when we're done using it.

2008-08-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Don't log giant messages to the debug log if we're
	setting a Node's text to a very large value. Also, use
	config.actionDelay for Node.click().

2008-08-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Put a timestamp on TCImage's diff.png.

2008-08-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Eliminate double slashes in TCImage.diff. Also remove
	do-nothing TCImage.__init__().

2008-08-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Rewrite TCImage to use PIL instead of ImageMagick.
	Update unit tests to reflect this rewrite.

2008-08-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Make TC a new-style class. No particular reason.

2008-08-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Make ResultsLogger log to a file no matter what.

2008-07-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Update to reflect API change in rawinput.

2008-02-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Add new parameter: checkForA11y, which defaults
	to True. If set to False, we assume accessibility is enabled.

	* dogtail/utils.py: Don't import gconf until necessary.

	* dogtail/tree.py, sniff/sniff: Don't check for accessibility unless
	config.config.checkForA11y is True.

2008-02-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Use click() instead of
	activate().

2008-02-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Add TCBool and TCNode.

2008-02-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py, dogtail/dump.py: Allow tree.Node.dump() to output
	to a file instead of stdout.

2008-02-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Use subprocess.Popen() instead of os.spawnvpe().

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Make run() return the PID.

2008-02-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Add loadAllTranslationsForLanguage().

2008-02-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Make distribution detection code a little less
	ugly. Remove docstrings from the Distro subclasses. Clean up some other
	documentation.

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Don't import the distro module until we actually
	need it.

	* dogtail/logging.py: Add an optional 'newline' arg to Logger.log(),
	which defaults to True. Passing False will cause the logger to not
	print or write a newline at the end of the message. Also stop catching
	some IOErrors, as that made the code awkward for no good reason.

2008-02-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/dump.py: Properly print Node.actions; ditch "xml" output as
	it was not even really a good start.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Strip some useless information of out
	Action.__str__().

2008-02-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/__init__.py: Fix inconsistent version number.

2008-02-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Fix minor inconsistency.

2008-01-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, dogtail/__init__.py: Bump version to 0.6.90.

2008-01-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* Makefile, MANIFEST.in: Remove mentions of debian/ and dogtail.spec.

2008-01-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec: Remove; see Fedora CVS for the canonical spec file.

2008-01-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* debian/: Remove as it's so out-of-date it's probably dangerous, and
	Debian doesn't use it anyway.

2008-01-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Refactor keyname <-> keysym conversion code.
	Remove unnecessary code, including the ctypes/xlib-based
	keyStringToKeyCode in favor of the gtk.gdk version. This completely
	removes the ctypes dependency.

2008-01-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Use a real GNOME session instead of a
	"fake" one.

2008-01-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/wrapped.py: Add dogtail.wrapped module, with superclasses
	for Node and Application wrappers to use in custom application
	wrappers. We need this because dogtail.tree.{Node,Application} are no
	longer wrapper classes, and thus can't be subclasses directly.

2008-01-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Change Node.valueMin and valueMax to Node.minValue
	and maxValue; add minValueIncrement.

2008-01-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Remove SniffModel.checkNodes() and
	SniffModel.addDeadNode() as we're not using them now that we have
	events working. While there are applications that don't have proper
	event support, the performance hit on constantly crawling over nodes
	is too large.

2008-01-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Make rows in the main TreeView expand/collapse on
	pressing Enter.

2008-01-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff, sniff.glade: Add a new tab to the bottom pane that
	lists the present states (just the ones supported by dogtail).

2008-01-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff, sniff/sniff.glade: Make the relation buttons only
	visible when a target exists. Also prepare
	SniffController.showRelationTarget() more prepared for when we add
	more relations to dogtail and sniff.

2008-01-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix a stupid error in the Node.dead check.

2008-01-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/glade, sniff/sniff: Split bottom pane into tabs: first is
	name, roleName, description, actions; second is (editable)text; third
	is relations. Currently there are only two relations: labeler and
	labelee. Relations in sniff are currently represented as buttons,
	which, when clicked, call the relation targets' blink() method. Also
	fix a minor bug in SniffController.setUpTable() where sometimes we
	would try to disconnect a signal handler multiple times.

2008-01-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Add a note about a broken unit test due to #498563.

2008-01-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add Node.dead property; useful if you're unsure if
	the accessible you're about to poke at is still valid, and don't feel
	like trying to catch 3 or more different exceptions.

2008-01-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Call SniffController.setUpTable() inside
	selectionChanged() instead of buttonPress().

2008-01-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Instead of processing events synchronously, put them in
	a queue to be processed during an idle function. Rewrite
	SniffModel.getPath().

2007-12-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Remove IconLogger. Make Logger not create
	logfiles until its log() method is called. This means sniff won't be
	creating empty logs all the time.

	* dogtail/config.py: Clean up some cruft and remove IconLogger stuff.

	* dogtail/trayicon.py: Removed.

2007-12-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Remove the 'finally' from a try-except-finally, since
	that would be the first time we broke compatibility with python 2.4,
	and it's far from worth it :)

2007-12-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Overhaul sniff to use pyatspi events to be notified
	when a node is renamed or gains/loses children. As a result,
	SniffModel does not use its addDeadNode() and checkNodes() methods.
	Those methods have not yet been removed, however. This change will
	result in properly-written applications working far better than before
	in sniff. Improperly-written apps (e.g. Firefox, but they know this)
	will behave better than sniff in 0.6.1; checkNodes() was causing
	serious slowdowns in some cases since it's fairly heavy code that
	needs to be looped continuously. Since sniff now has to do a lot less
	work than it did ever before, it should be somewhat faster in all
	cases.

2007-12-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff, sniff/glade: Add 'Set Root' and 'Unset Root' menu items
	to Sniff's View menu. Useful if you want to dig into a single app and
	want to reduce the amount of scrolling around necessary slightly.

2007-12-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Improve the removal of dead nodes from SniffModel,
	mainly by removing the highest-level dead node in the case that an
	entire subtree is found to be dead. Thanks to Michal Babej for the
	initial patch. Closes: #503056.

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Make Action.__node public (i.e. rename to
	Action.node).

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Force Node._getChildren() to return an empty list
	if the node's parent is a hyper link.

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Er, fix typo in last commit.

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add AccessibleValue support. Thanks to Pelya for
	submitting a patch before the port was merged.

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix typo.

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Show lines interconnecting TreeView rows.

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Expand the root node of the TreeView on startup.

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Move SniffModel.getNodeAttr() to SniffController, modify
	it to be specific to the 'name' property of a node. That function is
	now called nameDataFunc(). The behavior of nameDataFunc() has also
	been changed: instead of changing the text of the TreeView cell
	representing a defunct Node to '(broken node)', it now flags the row
	for removal by adding a reference to it to SniffModel.deadNodes. Every
	1000ms SniffModel will prune such rows from itself. In my tests, this
	caused no extra measurable increase in CPU utilization.	Also, remove
	all columns in SniffModel other than the node column, as the rest were
	not being used anyway.

2007-12-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Refactor sniff. Organize into 3 classes: SniffApp with
	methods	for setting up the application; SniffModel as a subclass of
	gtk.TreeStore; SniffController for poking at the SniffModel and
	gtk.TreeView instances.

2007-12-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Fall back to using a gtk.gdk.Keymap
	implementation of keyStringToKeyCode() if ctypes is not available.
	This will probably become the default implementation.

2007-12-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add a patch from Michal Babej to fix a python 2.4
	compatibility issue. Closes: #502324.

2007-12-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Only write the script preamble once.

2007-12-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Make the Close button in sniff's About dialog actually
	close the dialog.

2007-11-30  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* Makefile: Minor update.

2007-11-30  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Add a note about a broken unit test due to #498557.

2007-11-30  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Port Accessible.Hypertext and Hyperlink support.
	tree.Link is now called LinkAnchor and is no longer a subclass of
	Node. The new behavior is now that when a Hypertext interface is found
	on a Node, that node will have one extra child Node per
	Hyperlink/anchor pair. The child Nodes will have a role name of 'hyper
	link' and the 'URL' property. Also, remove much dead code.

2007-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add a patch from Cole Robinson to both make
	all focus.*() queries return a Boolean based on their success and to
	make the failure warning more verbose.

	* dogtail/config.py, dogtail/logging.py: Add a patch from Cole
	Robinson to allow the logging of debug information to stdout to be
	disabled via config.logDebugToStdOut. Still enabled by default.

2007-10-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py,
	examples/gedit-test-utf8-tree-api.py: Tweak slightly to work with the
	new dogtail behavior of click() using raw mouse events.

2007-10-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Remove all calls to time.sleep().

2007-10-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add some missing doDelay()'s. Also remove a chunk
	of dead code.

2007-10-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/errors.py, dogtail/tc.py: Fix encoding headers.

2007-10-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* MAINTAINERS: Updated.

2007-08-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Update and clean up the toplevel docstring.

2007-08-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Rewrite Node.__doc__.

2007-08-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Remove some redundant documentation from
	Node.__doc__.

2007-08-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Port the Action class over. Mainly needed to get at
	keybindings.

2007-08-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/__init__.py: Make __init__.py import pyatspi.

2007-08-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Update unit tests with API changes: Node States (from
	the old stateSet) are accessed directly, e.g. node.sensitive;
	read-only attributes now raise AttributeError instead of
	ReadOnlyError; atspi.SpiException has been replaced by
	CORBA.COMM_FAILURE.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Replace ReadOnlyError with AttributeError. Also
	make Node.doAction() raise NotSensitiveError if necessary.

2007-08-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix Application.window() to not try to initialize
	the Window class.

2007-08-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Port setting of Node.combovalue and additionally
	allow retrieval of the value.

2007-08-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Port Node.caretOffset.

2007-08-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add most of the rest of the checks from the old
	Node.children into the new one, i.e. children limits and null-child
	filtering. Also, when filtering null children, warn if
	config.debugSearching is True.

2007-07-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Handle broken nodes more gracefully.

2007-07-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Minor change in how we keep track of
	keyboard press/release events.

2007-07-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Port dogtail-recorder to pyatspi. Remove
	some dead code. Add lots of comments. The keyboard modifier processing
	had to be rewritten. As a bonus, things like <Shift><Home> should
	actually get noticed now. Also, the madness that was FakeNode is no
	more.

2007-07-25  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Fix duplicate checking in
	loadTranslationsFromPackageMoFiles(). Closes: #452232.

2007-06-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/dump.py: Remove SIGINT handler.

2007-06-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Port Selection stuff to pyatspi and convert to use
	normal instance methods and properties.

2007-06-20  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/no-help-at-all.py: Add patch from Jan Hutař to use
	cgi.escape() where necessary.

2007-06-20  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/filechooser-stress-test.py: Add patch from Jan Hutař to add
	i18n support.

2007-05-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix a minor bug in Node._fastFindChild() that
	caused a non-recursive search to halt completely if a null child was
	encountered.

2007-05-30  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Move some documentation into the new properties.
	Remove some unhelpful documentation. Further clean up bits of
	documentation here and there. Note: not done with docs yet :)

2007-05-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Remove actual search code from Node.findChild() and
	use pyatspi.utils.findDescendent, via a new Node._fastFindChild()
	function.

2007-05-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/predicate.py: Turn all predicates' satisfiedByNode() functions
	into pseudo-staticmethods, so we can pass those methods directly to the
	search methods in pyatspi.utils.

2007-05-25  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Port Sniff to pyatspi. It should all work now, but
	there could be a bug or two.

2007-05-25  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Begin port from pyspi to pyatspi. Disable __init__,
	__getattr__, __setattr__, __str__ while their functionality is ported.
	Attributes that were accessed via __[gs]attr__ are now declared as
	properties, to make the code easier to read and document.

2007-05-25  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Actually obey config.logDebugToFile.

	* dogtail/config.py: Implement runtime changing of logDebugToFile.

2007-05-25  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Fix logic in first unit test.

2007-05-16  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Port from pyspi to pyatspi. Use ctypes and Xlib
	to do the keystring -> keycode keycode conversion.

2007-05-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py, recorder/dogtail-recorder,
	scripts/dogtail-run-headless, sniff/sniff: Replace 'except:' with
	'except: Exception', since we don't want KeyboardInterrupt and
	SystemExit to be ignored in any of those cases. See:
	http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0352/. Also catch only ImportError
	in once case inside of dogtail-recorder.

2007-05-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Add patch from Michal Babej to correctly reset the
	actions label when a Node with no actions is selected. Closes:
	#432999.

2007-03-16  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py: Add patch from Fernando Herrera to fix building from a
	subversion checkout. Closes: #418923.

2007-02-20  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/predicate.py: Add unit tests for all predicates.

2007-02-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add patch from Michal Babej to fix
	Node.childLabelled().

2007-02-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/no-help-at-all.py: Add patch from Michal Babej to use
	cgi.escape() to escape content for SGML.

2007-02-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Add patch from Michal Babej that removes some
	confusion in TCImage.compare(), and also fixes a unit test.

2007-02-08  Daniel Drake  <d.drake@mmm.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix wrong logic in Node.selectedChildren
	implementation

2007-02-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Make isA11yEnabled() look at $GTK_MODULES, too.

2006-11-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: When creating the default directories for logs,
	etc. (/tmp/dogtail/*), create them world-writable so that they may be
	shared by multiple users.

2006-11-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Add parameter 'childrenLimit', which is an integer
	representing how many children of a Node instance to return at maximum.
	The default is 100.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Only return config.childrenLimit children. Log a
	warning to the debug logger the first time the list is clipped, but
	remain silent on subsequent occurences.

2006-11-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/test-events.py: Make sure dogtail.tree is imported. Closes:
	#374898. Also add warning that the script is outdated, may do evil, and
	will probably be removed soon.

2006-11-15  David Malcolm  <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: ensure that a Node and a Link's children attribute
	always is a list and hence iteratable (previously returned None for
	Link instances and for Node instances that had __hideChildren set);
	similar fix for the Node.findChildren method

2006-10-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Make run() insert a space while concatenating
	the binary name and arguments to pass. Closes: #364553.

2006-10-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, dogtail/__init__.py, NEWS: Post-release version bump.

2006-10-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* Released 0.6.1.

2006-10-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update.

2006-10-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/data/GNOME-Street1.png, examples/data/GNOME-Street.png,
	examples/data/g-star1.png, examples/data/g-star.png: Remove and
	replace with far smaller test images.

	* examples/data/10b.png, examples/data/10w.png, examples/data/20b.png,
	examples/data/20w.png: Add, to replace older, larger test images.

	* dogtail/tc.py: Update to reflect the change in test images.

2006-10-12  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Keep track of which 'frame' (window) the
	widget we're poking is under. If necessary, write out 'focus.frame()'
	lines for that frame. This should keep us from getting confused about
	which non-dialog window of a given application we care about.

2006-10-12  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Be consistent about what name we use for
	the recorder internally.

2006-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update with changes since 0.6.0.

2006-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Make typeText('foo\nbar') work again.

2006-10-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Fix up Solaris detection so that an /etc/release
	that does not contain 'Solaris' doesn't prevent the exception from
	being raised.

2006-10-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Re-add Dave Malcolm's patch to add syntax
	hilighting to the script view, which was accidentally dropped. Closes:
	#345374.

2006-10-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Add patch from Brian Cameron to detect Solaris.
	Closes: #360479. Also, check for Fedora before checking for Red Hat.

2006-10-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Make TranslatableString.matchedBy() check for
	equality before trying to match via regular expression. This will
	ensure that traditional, exact-string searches will work regardless of
	the presence of any regexy-looking characters. Additionaly escape '('
	and ')', since grouping will never need to be used in this context.
	Closes: #348891.

2006-10-02  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Fix 'Technolofy' typo :)

2006-09-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Add support for recording right clicks.
	It mostly works, but I'm seeing some inconsistency regarding what gets
	focus when a right-click event occurs. For example, when a nautilus
	icon seems to retain focus only about half the times it is
	right-clicked; the other half, the context menu receives the focus.
	Obviously, when that happens, the recorder records the wrong event.

2006-09-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder, sniff/sniff: Stop whining if the glade
	file isn't in the current directory.

2006-09-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder, recorder/recorder.glade: Implement script
	playback using python's threading module.

2006-09-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Make type() and keyCombo() fall back to their
	corresponding function in rawinput if focus.widget.node == None.

2006-09-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder, recorder/recorder.glade: Remove Quit button
	and add Play button. The Play button isn't fully implemented yet.

2006-09-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder, recorder/recorder.glade: Remove combo box
	since OOScriptWriter needs fixing. Also remove the expander since a
	GTK bug was keeping it from expanding properly.

2006-09-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Make pressKey(), which is used by typeText(),
	use UniCharToKeySym(). Now typeText('foo, bar; baz!?!') works again.

2006-09-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/filechooser-stress-test.py: Apply a patch from Michal Babej
	to correctly look for the u'Open files\u2026' dialog.

	* examples/no-help-at-all.py: Apply a patch from Michal Babej fail
	gracefully if no argument was supplied, and also to start the
	requested app if it is not running.

2006-09-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Refactor logging mechanism. DebugLogger is now
	just Logger, and LogWriter is now a Logger subclass called
	ResultsLogger. Logger can (and will by default) write its output to a
	file in config.logDir. To disable the logging of debug information to
	a file, set config.logDebugToFile to False. ResultsLogger now also
	prints its results to standard out.

	* dogtail/distro.py, dogtail/tree.py, dogtail/utils.py:
	Replace all print statements with calls to the debug logger.

	* dogtail/tc.py: Update to reflect changes in dogtail.logging.

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Don't raise a FocusError if
	config.fatalErrors is False. Instead, spit a warning out via
	dogtail.errors.warn(), which relays to the debug logger.

	* dogtail/errors.py: Add warn(), which is the mechanism by which an
	exception is replaced by a warning if config.fatalErrors is False.
	Uses dogtail.logging.debugLogger, which is a dogtail.logging.Logger
	instance.

	* dogtail/config.py: Add two new parameters: 'fatalErrors', which
	specifies whether errors encountered while using dogtail.procedural
	should be considered fatal; and 'logDebugToFile', which specifies
	whether to write debug output to a file. They default to False and
	True, respectively.

	* dogtail/predicate.py: Give debugNames to all the Predicates that
	were missing them.

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Don't spam warnings and probably-useless tracebacks
	when a broken app spews fake UTF-8.

	* dogtail/__init__.py: Post-release version bump. Add the errors
	module to __all__.

	* NEWS, setup.py: Post-release version bump.

2006-09-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update.

2006-09-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Replace newlines in node.name values with
	an escaped '\n' in ProceduralScriptWriter.recordClick(). Remove a debug
	statement in EventRecorder.onKeyPress().

2006-09-11  David Malcolm  <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/yelp.py, dogtail/apps/wrappers/mozilla.py,
	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/gnomepanel.py: rename self.version in each app
	wrapper to avoid a naming collision with the synthesized Tree.version
	attribute.

2006-09-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff, recorder/dogtail-recorder: Add patch from Tim Lee so
	sniff and dogtail-recorder can find glade files even if they're not
	installed into the /usr prefix. Closes: #353719, #353731.

2006-09-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py, sniff/sniff, recorder/dogtail-recorder,
	dogtail/tree.py: Add utility functions to check whether accessibility
	is enabled via GConf, and either present a dialog asking to enable it
	(for sniff & dogtail-recorder) or just bail (for scripts).

2006-09-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Make sure the recorder can't record
	itself. Also remove some old comments.

2006-09-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Also use safeDecode() instead of calling any
	string's encode() method directly. Now i18n.py should work exclusively
	with Unicode internally, and the safe conversion means that dogtail
	should never crash because of an invalid Unicode string ever again.

2006-09-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Add safeDecode(), a function based on the fix
	committed on 2006-08-22. Use it instead of calling any string's
	decode() method directly. Closes: #354515.

2006-09-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Fix syntax error, and look for
	gnome-settings-daemon in /usr/libexec before $PATH. Closes: #354518.

2006-09-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Rewrite screenshot() to use GDK instead of
	ImageMagick.

2006-09-06  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Add patch from Tim Lee to fix up SuSe support.
	Closes: #353601.

2006-09-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Don't use an IconLogger by default.

	* dogtail/config.py: Add useIconLogger setting, which defaults to
	False. Setting it to True enables the IconLogger immediately. Add
	documentation and a unit test to that effect.

2006-08-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Ignore any SpiException, only when trying to access
	root.children. This is so people using broken applications while
	trying to test non-broken applications don't have to suffer.

2006-08-25  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add patch from Chris Lee to add the 'checked' Node
	attribute, which indicates whether the Node is a check box that is
	currently checked.

2006-08-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Add parameter 'typingDelay', defaulting to 0.075.

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Make typeText() use pressKey(). Add
	keySymAliases for '\t' and '\n'.

2006-08-23  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, MANIFEST.in: Remove mentions of textinput.glade.

2006-08-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Remove the text input UI. Implement actual
	keystroke recording. Add support for the ProceduralScriptWriter to
	write out script calls. The OOScriptWriter is unsupported at this time.
	Also, make exceptions occuring inside AT-SPI-registered callbacks more
	informative by printing their tracebacks before they're lost in the
	marshaling process.

	* recorder/recorder.glade: Remove 'Input Text' button.

	* recorder/textinput.glade: Remove glade file for text input UI.

2006-08-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add type(), which for now just calls
	focus.widget.node.typeText(). Add keyCombo(), which for now just calls
	focus.widget.node.keyCombo().

2006-08-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add new Node attributes: 'focusable' and 'focused'.
	Both are read-only Boolean values. 'focusable' indicates whether the
	Node is able of taking keyboard focus. 'focused' indicates whether the
	Node currently has keyboard focus. Remove Node.rawType() and move its
	functionality to Node.typeText(). In Node.typeText(), if the node is
	focusable and not focused, try to grab its focus with Node.grabFocus
	before using rawtype.typeText() to do the typing. If the node is not
	focusable, just append the string to the node's 'text' property. Add
	Node.keyCombo(), which does a similar thing but cannot have a fallback
	mechanism.

2006-08-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Add keyCombo(), which takes a string in the same
	format of gtk.accelerator_parse(), e.g. "<Control><Alt>Delete" and
	generates the appropriate keyboard events to simulate the user pressing
	that combination. Add __buildKeyStringsDict(), which essentially
	generates an inverted version of the keySyms dict. Add
	keySymToUniChar(), which takes a keysym and returns the corresponding
	Unicode character, if one exists. Add uniCharToKeySym(), which does the
	reverse. Also add a few more keysym aliases to the keySymAliases dict.

2006-08-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: If we encounter a UnicodeDecodeError because of an
	invalid string, print the exception plus a warning explanation, and
	contintue by decoding the string and replacing invalid characters with
	question marks.

2006-08-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder.desktop: Move to the 'Programming'
	category in the menu.

	* sniff/sniff.desktop: Move to the 'Programming' category in the menu.

2006-08-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Use the python GConf bindings.

2006-08-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS, setup.py, dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py,
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py: Post-release version bump.

2006-08-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	Released 0.5.2.

2006-08-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update.

2006-08-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: Put a time.sleep() in GtkDemoTest.tearDown() to let
	gtk-demo actually die before launching another. AT-SPI seems to really
	disapprove of the speed at which it was being hammered.

2006-08-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update.

2006-07-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py, dogtail/tree.py: Remove shebang lines.

2006-07-28  David Malcolm  <dmalcom@redhat.com>

	* Makefile: add a working default target ('all') and an install target,
	so that it builds within jhbuild (Fixes: #318535)

2006-07-27  David Malcolm  <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* tests/Node.py: added TestExceptions: ensure that when an app dies,
	attempts to contact it result in an exception being raised (even more
	final part of bg #318135)

2006-07-27  David Malcolm  <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: handle broken communication with nodes (e.g. for a
	crashed app) by displaying "broken node" and an error icon (hopefully
	the final part of bug #318135)

2006-07-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Use gtk.kesyms to look up keysyms. Retain
	compatibility with old names via a keySymAliases dict. Also, use only
	one atspi.EventGenerator.

2006-07-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Set GTK_MODULES='gail:atk-bridge' in run() before
	executing the app, to make sure it is accessible. It seems most
	non-GNOME apps need this set.

2006-07-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Add a UI for setting the text property of
	a Node instance. While recording, you click 'Input Text', and a dialog
	pops up. Click the node whose text you want to set, then type the text
	into the dialog and press OK. The recorder sets the node's text, then
	writes out lines in the script to do the same.

	* recorder/recorder.glade: Add 'Input Text' button.

	* recorder/textinput.glade: Add new glade file: the text input dialog.

	* MANIFEST.in: Add textinput.glade to tarball.

	* setup.py: Add textinput.glade to packages.

2006-07-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Initialize EventRecorder.listeners to an
	empty list, to fix a traceback when the user tries to quit the
	recorder without actually recording anything.

2006-07-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Make the script TextView editable at
	all times, so the user can add comments and the like while recording.

2006-07-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-tree-api.py: Add patch from Len DiMaggio
	to fix this script. Also make the script search for u'Save As\u2026'
	in addition to 'Save As...' for the dialog title. Closes: #340734.

2006-07-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec: Forward-port a fix from the Fedora Extras specfile,
	fixing a broken call to desktop-file-install. Closes: #347322.

2006-07-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Rewrite the script in Python. It now
	accepts command line options to specify what session is to be used.
	Currently those are: '--gnome' or '-g' for the old minimal GNOME
	session, and '--none' or '-n' for just metacity. The script also has
	a usage statement and helpful error messages. In general it's more
	featureful, robust and easy to use. Closes: #344902.

	* scripts/dogtail-detect-session: Also exit normally if any apps are
	found at all.

2006-06-30  David Malcolm  <david@localhost.localdomain>

	* tests/Node.py: add unit test for getting bogus attributes of a Node;
	document many of the existing unit tests; add unit tests for writing to
	a read-only attribute of Node; fix some typos in the names of the unit
	tests; check that Node.extents has non-zero size, and that Node.size is
	non-zero

	* dogtail/tree.py: make attempts to write to a read-only attribute of
	Node raise a ReadOnlyError, rather than fall through to an
	AttributeError; remove the old stubbed unit test from the tail of the
	file

2006-06-29  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add warning not to read without understanding
	the API.

2006-06-27  David Malcolm  <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: use GtkSourceView if available to get
	syntax-highlighting.  Closes: #345374.

	* tests/Node.py: new file: unit tests for the dogtail.Node class.

	* tests: new subdirectory, to hold unit tests for Dogtail itself

2006-06-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Make SearchError a proper Exception subclass.

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Prepare module for support for accepting
	regular expressions as 'name' arguments. Use the IsAnApplicationNamed
	predicate in FocusApplication. Remove unused 'description' arguments.

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Add regular expression support to
	TranslatableString.matchedBy(). This means that any 'name' argument
	supports regular expression matching, by virtue of the fact that all
	Predicate subclasses uses TranslatableString.matchedBy() for 'name'
	arguments.

2006-06-16  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add patch from Dave Malcolm to work around the
	problem where pyspi would essentially just stop working, until the
	user logged out and back in. Closes: #321273.

2006-06-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Fix help(dogtail.config.config). Fix outdated
	documentation for dogtail.config.config by reorganizing and documenting
	accidentally-undocumented parameters.

2006-06-02  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Fix unit test that was broken by a commit from
	2005-11-01, which made config.ensureSensitivity default to True. The
	unit test wasn't updated in that commit. The unit test now doesn't
	assume what the default is, and uses the value obtained from
	config.defaults. Thanks to Len DiMaggio for reporting. Closes: #342028.

2006-05-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/recorder.glade: Remove the 'Stop' button, and add a 'Clear'
	button.

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Make the 'Record' button turn into a
	'Stop' button after it is pressed, and vice versa. Add
	toggleRecording() to RecorderGUI and remove startRecording(). Make
	RecorderGUI.quit() stop the recording before it calls gtk.main_quit().

2006-04-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Make ProceduralScriptWriter.recordClick()
	write out correct calls for Node instances that don't have
	action['click'] and instead need, for example, 'activate'. If other
	actions aren't available, use the node's select(). If that doesn't
	work, do a click(raw=True), to spoof raw mouse input. Also, remove
	some old AttributeError handlers from FakeNode.__init__(). Also, make
	EventRecorder stop listening to window:create events, since those are
	just thrown away. Also, refactor and rewrite
	EventRecorder.onMouseButton() to be much more accurate in detecting
	clicks. Reporting the wrong nodes happens far less often, now. There
	is still the problem of clicks getting dropped when the mouse button
	isn't help down for, say, 200ms. Clicks on toolbar buttons tend to get
	dropped too. But there are no more false clicks, e.g. clicking on a
	non-accessible application still recorded a (bogus) action. Also, make
	clicking on table cells work properly, working around the fact that
	mouse:button events are always reported by the table and not the cell,
	by finding the smallest child of the table whose extents the event
	occured inside.

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add Select, an Action subclass that doesn't
	deal with actions. It lets us have select() and deselect() calls. The
	former is how page tabs are activated.

2006-04-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Restore sane default window size.

2006-04-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix Node.size by using the values from
	Node.__accessible.getExtents() instead of .getSize().

2006-04-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Change the way Node reports that attributes
	provided by specialized Accessible interface extensions do not apply.
	For example, for some instance 'foo', trying to access 'foo.text' when
	the AccessibleText interface is not available for that node will now
	return None instead of raising an AttributeError (if it were
	available, and the text was zero-length, it would have returned '').
	Trying to access 'foo.children' will return [] instead of raising an
	AttributeError. The reason for this change is that these conditions
	are not "exceptional". Trying to access
	'foo.thisIsANonexistentAttribute' would be exceptional. Also, add a
	ReadOnlyError exception which is raised when, for example, someone
	tries to set 'foo.text' when 'foo' does not have an
	AccessibleEditableText implementation.

	* sniff/sniff: Update Sniff to reflect the removal of most of Node's
	AttributeErrors.

	* sniff/sniff.glade: Use a GtkWindow instead of a GnomeApp. The latter
	was unnecessary and forced us to use widgets we didn't want.

2006-04-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Scroll to the end of the TextView after
	inserting a new line, so you can watch the script as it's written.

2006-04-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder, recorder/recorder.glade: Add ComboBox to
	allow selection of ScriptWriter. Make ProceduralScriptWriter default.
	Remove those assertions, because they were evil.

2006-04-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Implement ProceduralScriptWriter class.
	It implements recordClick() just like OOScriptWriter, but it also has
	the special method findAncestor(), for deciding whether the script
	will need to do a focus.application() or focus.dialog(). For this, I
	needed to implement a FakeNode.__cmp__(). It only compares the name,
	roleName and description of the FakeNode instances. Bother me if you
	need it to compare more attributes for it to work. Make
	ProceduralScriptWriter the default ScriptWriter for now. Also, add a
	couple assertions in various methods to make sure the node parameter
	is never None.

	* HACKING: Remove all the notes about forcing editors to use tabs for
	indentation. Closes: #318833.

2006-04-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff.desktop: Move to the 'Accessories' category in the menu.

2006-04-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder.desktop: Add desktop file for
	dogtail-recorder.

	* MANIFEST.in, setup.py: Ship and install dogtail-recorder.desktop.

2006-04-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/recorder.glade: Add gtk.Expander and	gtk.TextView
	to allow viewing and editing a script. Note that when the Expander is
	collapsed, the main window doesn't shrink back to its original size.
	This is a bug.

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Make ScriptWriters either store
	the script in a normal Python string, or a gtk.TextView if it's
	available. Continue to print the script to standard out, for
	debugging. Implement saving scripts via the GUI, automatically
	appending a '.py' to the filename if necessary. Also, add some basic
	docstrings to some OOScriptWriter methods (mostly to note that the
	keyboard stuff doesn't work yet).

2006-03-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Added support for AccessibleSelection to Node, via
	Node.{de,}select(), Node.{de,}selectAll(), Node.isSelected,
	Node.selectedChildren and Node.indexInParent.. Thanks to Peter
	Johanson and Jose Dapena Paz. Closes: #336562.

2006-03-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: Add the new recorder files to the tarball.

	* setup.py: Add the new recorder files to packages.

2006-03-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Add GUI with Record, Stop, Save and Quit
	buttons. Add new methods to EventRecorder: startRecording() and
	stopRecording(), and move all the event listener (de)registration and
	and AT-SPI event loop handling into those methods. Remove hack that
	killed the recorder when an Edit menu was clicked, since there is a
	working Stop button. This requires today's pyspi HEAD.

	* recorder/recorder.glade: Add Glade file for dogtail-recorder.

2006-03-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/recorder.py: Move to recorder/dogtail-recorder.

	* recorder/dogtail-recorder: Move from examples/recorder.py.

2006-03-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/recorder.py: Remove the Writer class and move its only
	method to the ScriptWriter class. Create a a subclass of
	dogtail.tree.node, called FakeNode, which can wrap a Node instance and
	store certain attributes of it, so AT-SPI calls are not used when
	reading them. This was necessary because events are useless if they
	are received after their source has been destroyed. For example, by
	storing recorder.lastFocusedNode as a FakeNode instead of a Node, if a
	Close button in a dialog is clicked we will still have all the
	information we need to record the event. So, make
	EventRecorder.on{Focus,Select}() store self.last{Focus,Select}edNode
	as FakeNodes. Also, make EventRecorder.onMouseButton() properly dance
	around dogtail.tree's handling of attributes. This will have to be
	fixed in the nearish future, though.

	* examples/recorder.py: s/Focussed/Focused/g. Add lastSelectedNode
	callbacks and event listener registration. s/MouseClick/MouseButton/g.
	Keep track of lastPressedNode and lastReleasedNode. Add code to try to
	detect the "real" source nodes by checking the X and Y coordinates of
	lastFocusedNode and lastSelectedNode. Add a way to exit the recorder -
	currently, clicking on an Edit menu will do it. When the
	OOScriptWriter is initialized, make it spit out "from dogtail.tree
	import *".

2006-03-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/predicate.py: Remove extra quotes from all the script
	generation code.

2006-03-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py,
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py, setup.py, NEWS: Post-release
	version bump.

2006-03-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	Released 0.5.1.

2006-03-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/recorder.py: Store each EventListener in a list instead of
	initializing it and throwing it away. Add the beginnings of a
	OOScriptWriter.recordKey() method - for when pyspi's DeviceListener
	works properly.

	* NEWS: Updated.

2006-03-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py, dogtail/rawinput.py, dogtail/i18n.py,
	dogtail/rawinput.py, dogtail/logging.py, dogtail/utils.py,
	dogtail/path.py: Remove '#!/usr/bin/env python' headers to fix rpmlint
	warnings. The rest apparently can keep them, since they have unit
	tests. Add UTF-8 encoding headers.

2006-02-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/predicate.py: Fix makeCamel() to deal with
	TranslatableString instances properly by calling str() on the
	parameter as a safeguard.

2006-02-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py,
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py: Belated post-release version bump.

2006-02-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py, dogtail/i18n.py, dogtail/logging.py,
	dogtail/tc.py, dogtail/trayicon.py, dogtail/tree.py,
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: s/  / /g. This will make it easier
	to convert to four-space indentation, since that's all the rage these
	days.

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/nautilus.py: Fix up indentation; was mixing
	tabs and spaces.

2006-02-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Tweak the FocusWidget and FocusDialog
	algorithms so that they store the predicate instance. That way, we can
	give more meaningful FocusErrors by passing the predicate's debugName.

2006-02-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* Makefile: Split 'rpm' target into 'rpm_prep' and 'rpm'. Add a new
	target, 'srpm', to build just a source RPM. Make it ignore
	BuildRequires. Make 'rpm' target only build binary RPMs. Don't make
	the 'tarball' target depend on the 'clean' target.

2006-02-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	Released 0.5.0.

2006-02-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* README: Add pointed to gedit-procedural example, and note that it's
	the most frequently updated.

2006-02-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Add some error checking to getSelectedNode(), to get
	rid of a (harmless, but scary) traceback on startup.

2006-02-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Update to use new icon path.

2006-02-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, sniff/sniff: Move sniff's application icons from
	/usr/share/pixmaps/ into /usr/share/hicolor/*/apps/.

	* setup.cfg: Remove.

2006-02-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* README: Add README file. It's a start.

2006-01-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py, dogtail/predicate.py dogtail/trayicon.py: Be much
	more intelligent about encodings. This should really, truly fix the
	last remaining blocker on the automatic runtime translation feature.
	Closes: 328652.

2006-01-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Generalize language detection.

2006-01-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/epiphany.py: Update to new Action API.

2006-01-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Comment out some super-verbose debug statements.

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Use a proper Unicode
	ellipsis.

2006-01-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Make sure we filter the list of mo-files so that
	we only get the ones in the target language.

2006-01-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Fix automatic runtime translation. Stop using
	gettext.dgettext(), and instead use the gettext.GNUTranslations class
	and its member function, ugettext(). This ensures that we always get
	Unicode back. As a consequence, stop caring about "domains" and just
	deal with mo-files. Remove getTranslationDomainsForPackage(). Closes:
	#328652. Also, fix isMoFile()'s regexp matching.

2006-01-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Comment out the warning about missing wnck
	bindings, since the functionality is nonworking anyway.

	* NEWS: Add note about the last change to dogtail.tree.

2006-01-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Use codecs.open()
	instead of open() for reading the UTF-8 files. open() apparently
	ignores encoding issues, and codecs.open() allows us to specify the
	encoding of the file. Add comments to that effect.

	* dogtail/tc.py: Make a note in TC.compare()'s docstring that
	codecs.open() must be used to open any non-ASCII files that are
	intended to be compared using that function.

2006-01-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Make screenshot() raise a DependencyNotFoundError
	if ImageMagick is not installed.

	* NEWS: Add note about the last change to screenshot().

2006-01-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Add notes about dogtail.errors and the change to TCImage.

2006-01-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/errors.py: Add errors.py, a module for generalized
	exceptions, i.e. its first exception: DependencyNotFoundError. Other
	exceptions such as distro.PackageNotFoundError and
	procedural.FocusError probably do not belong here.

	* dogtail/tc.py: Give a better error message if TCImage is
	instantiated while ImageMagick is not installed, by raising a
	DependencyNotFoundError.

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Remove unncessary
	TCImage instantiation. Also, be aware that the naming of the "Save as"
	dialog changed slightly. Try both strings.

2006-01-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py: Change author_email to dogtail-list@gnome.org.

2006-01-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py,
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py: Bump version numbers.

2006-01-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: Add NEWS file to tarball.

2006-01-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update with changes since 0.4.3.

2006-01-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Add comment about how to
	turn on automatic translation.

2005-12-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Update to the new Action API.

2005-12-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add patch from David Malcolm to add a single
	shortcut method for Node.doAction('click') - simply Node.click() as a
	compromise. Closes: #321196.

2005-11-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Remove spurious print statement from screenshot().

2005-11-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Reformat to make more readable.

2005-11-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Re-add helper methods that were removed on 11-08.
	Change Action API from "Node.actionName()" to
	"Node.doAction(actionName)" for an action whose name is	'actionName'.

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Update to new Action API.

2005-11-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* debian/control: Fix typo. Thanks to Alex Roitman for reminding me
	to commit this. Closes: #322169.

2005-11-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Make TCImage.compare() work around a change in
	ImageMagick that broke the method, by comparing its version string
	against the one at which it changed. Closes: #321431.

2005-11-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Add config parameter 'blinkOnActions'. The
	parameter defaults to False. Set it to True to watch your scripts
	blinken die lichten!

	* dogtail/tree.py: Make Action.do() call blink() on the associated
	node.

2005-11-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Add Blinker class from sniff/sniff, which, upon
	initialization, blinks a rectangular shape onscreen.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add Node.blink(), which blinks a rectangle around
	the node's extents (if it has extents). This is intended to help
	debugging situations where, during script writing, the node found in a
	search is not what was expeced.

	* sniff/sniff: Remove Blinker class and blinkExtents(). Make
	selectionChanged() just call node.blink().

2005-11-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Move blink interval constant into Blinker class. Make
	Blinker.__init__()'s count argument optional, defaulting to 2.

2005-11-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add Hyperlink and Hypertext support via the Link
	class (subclass of Node). Link objects have a roleName of 'hyper link'
	and a 'jump' action in Epiphany - I haven't tested Firefox yet.

2005-11-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add debug logging to Node.rawClick() and
	Node.rawType().

2005-11-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: reduce it to a single blink (2 calls of the callback)
	rather than two blinks (4 calls) to avoid visual confusion when
	rapidly changing the selection.

2005-11-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: implement a selectionChanged callback for the tree
	view; use it to make the extents of the selected node blink, porting
	code from at-poke's src/poke.c (though without the grabs that uses).
	Closes: #321655

2005-11-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: remove the unused "populate" function

2005-11-16  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Properly catch an AttributeError where an
	AssertionError was previously expected. Closes: #321564:.

2005-11-16  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Make FocusDialog.__call__() pass
	recursive=False to FocusApplication.node.findChild(). Closes: #321624.

2005-11-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Make LogWriter print the name of the logfile
	just before it creates it.

2005-11-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Fix TimeStamp.zeroPad() by defaulting to
	width=2. Fix TimeStamp.fileStamp() by renaming 'long' argument to
	'addTime'.

2005-11-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Use {get,set}attr() inside
	FocusBase.__{get,set}attr__() instead of
	FocusBase.node.__{get,set}attr__(), in order to composite attributes
	that aren't dynamically generated.

2005-11-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Fix compositing of Node properties into
	FocusBase subclasses.

2005-11-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Fix focusing. There are supposed to be three
	different focus 'slots': application, dialog, and widget. Previously
	Actions were not operating on the same nodes as FocusWidget as
	intended. Also remove a couple print statements left over from
	previous debugging.

2005-11-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: rewrite pressKey() to take as an argument the
	English key name as seen on the keyboard, look its keysym up via a
	dict, and pass that value to AT-SPI to synthesize the event. This
	means each key will have to be added to the keySyms dict explicitly,
	but I think it's worth it for the API to make sense and be portable.
	Add docstrings to pressKey() and typeText().

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Fix TimeStamper.zeroPad()'s padding, and note in
	its docstring that it will not truncate.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/predicate.py, dogtail/rawinput.py: Clean up imports.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Add typeText() and pressKey(). For now
	pressKey() takes an integer keycode argument, but I'd like to enable
	something like "pressKey('Return')" in the future.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Make Node.grabFocus() get added to the object in
	Node.__init__(), but only of the node wraps a Component. Also add
	Node.rawClick() and Node.rawType().

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Implement click(raw=True).

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Make FocusWidget.__call__() actually raise a
	FocusError if it can't find what it's looking for.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add menu(), Focus.frame(), Focus.window().

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add Node.position, Node.size, and Node.grabFocus()
	for those Nodes wrapping an AccessibleComponent.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Don't initialize TC's self.{baseline,undertest,result} so
	that TC.compare() defaults to failing. Make sure to assign
	self.{baseline,undertest} to the value of the arguments passed to
	compare(). Fix several unit tests to specify their strings as being
	Unicode-encoded. Strings comparisons now fail properly. Thanks to
	Muktha Narayan for reporting the bug and attaching a proposed patch.
	Closes: #321151.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: s@scripts/pound@examples/data@g to reflect the
	directory naming that occured a while back.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix bogus logic in Node.__getattr__() where if, for
	example, a Node had multiple actions such that
	node.actions[0].name == 'activate' and node.actions[1].name == 'menu',
	calling node.menu() would fail.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Remove "various wrapper/helper search methods":
	Node.{child, menu, menuItem, textentry, button, childLabelled,
	childNamed, tab}(). Node.menu() conflicted with the other Node.menu(),
	which is needed to execute the AccessibleAction's 'menu' action.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Fix "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error
	in FocusBase.__getattr__() when 'help(dogtail.procedural)' is called
	right after 'import dogtail.procedural'.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* Makefile: Build RPMs as a normal user. Thanks again to Bastien
	Nocera for the patch! Closes: #320983.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec: Make __os_install_post macro one line to fix building
	RPMs on RHEL4 and earlier. Thanks to Bastien Nocera for the patch.
	Closes: #320978.

2005-11-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Add PackageDb.getMoFiles(), returning (mostly)
	all the .mo files in the distro, optionally for just one locale. Move
	all PackageDb subclasses into the top level of the module, and prefix
	their names with a '_' so it is possible to subclass them. Add
	UbuntuAptPackageDb to make it possible for getMoFiles() to search in
	/usr/share/locale and /usr/share/locale-langpack. Add JHBuild class, a
	subclass of Distro, and JhBuildPackageDB class, a subclass of
	PackageDb. JhBuildPackageDB.getFiles() and
	JhBuildPackageDB.getVersion() are not implemented yet, as I haven't
	figured out just how they should work yet.

2005-11-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Make AptPackageDb only call apt_pkg.GetCache()
	once and save the cache object, to save time in the case where
	multiple calls to getVersion() or getDependencies() need to be made.

2005-11-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Move *PackageDb class declarations and
	instantiations into their Distro classes' __init__() methods. Remove
	all __make*PackageDb() functions. Make dogtail.distro.packageDb a
	reference to dogtail.distro.distro.packageDb, where the second
	'distro' is the Distro subclass instance to preserve the API.

2005-11-02  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec: Bump version number.

2005-11-02  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Save the value of the GConf key
	/desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility, then set it to true before
	running the test. After the test is run, restore the old value.
	Closes: #320548.

2005-11-02  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Preserve the return code of the script
	being exectued. Closes: #320535.

2005-11-01  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: added setBogusGConfAccountData()
	function as a way of bypassing the first-time wizard

2005-11-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Make config.ensureSensitivity False by default.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Make Action.do() spit out a warning if the Node
	instance is not sensitive and config.ensureSensitivity is False.

2005-11-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Implement a proper NotSensitiveError exception.
	Make Action.do() raise it instead of a string literal when the
	action's Node instance is not sensitive, and config.ensureSensitivity
	is True.

2005-11-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Change format of TimeStamp.fileStamp() to
	filename_YYYYMMDD-hhmmss or just filename_YYYYMMDD, controlled by the
	new optional argument 'long'. Fix docstrings of TimeStamp.fileStamp()
	and TimeStamp.entryStamp().

	* dogtail/utils.py: Rewrite most of screenshot(), and add assertions
	that config.scratchDir exists before the screenshot is taken, and that
	the screenshot file exists before the function returns. Generate
	screenshot filenames using logging.TimeStamp.entryStamp() by default.
	A call like "screenshot(file='foo') will name the file
	'foo_YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.png', but the timestamping can be disabled with a
	call like "screenshot(file='foo', timeStamp=False)", naming the file
	just 'foo.png'. Additionally, the file argument may specify an
	extension, e.g. 'foo.png' or 'foo.jpg'. Make screenshot() return the
	full path to the screenshot taken. Clarify screenshot()'s docstring.

2005-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Add URL to bug filed at bugzilla.redhat.com to the
	note about popt making gettext.dgettext() bail.

2005-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Add an Ubuntu subclass of Debian, since Ubuntu in
	some cases does things wildly different. For a good example, see
	dogtail/i18n.py.

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Make automatic translation work on Ubuntu with a
	special-case: If a script needing automatic translation is running on
	Ubuntu, look for translations in the language-pack-gnome-$LANGUAGE
	package before the actual package under test. Note that this makes
	automatic translation significantly slower. Also, remove the
	'dogtail' prefix from references to dogtail.config and dogtail.distro.

2005-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Only be verbose about setting a Node.text attribute
	if config.debugSearching is turned on.

2005-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Add automatic
	translation support (it's a one-liner!). Don't set $LANG from inside
	the script. Add a line for config.debugTranslation, but comment both
	debug lines out.

2005-10-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Implement proper Exceptions PackageNotFoundError
	and DistributionNotSupportedError.

2005-10-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Implement getFiles() and getDependencies() in
	AptPackageDb.

2005-10-28  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: New file, providing i18n facilities.

	* dogtail/config.py: Add debugTranslation boolean

	* examples/i18n-test.py: New example, demonstrating the i18n hooks

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add a getUserVisibleStrings() method to Node

	* dogtail/predicate.py: Rewrite all string matching within predicates to
	use the dogtail.i18n.TranslatableString class, and rewriting as
	necessary.

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: Use the evolution-connector
	package's translations by default.

	* examples/evolution-test-switching-components.py: Use the evolution
	package's translations

2005-10-28  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Use correct exceptions for unimplemented functions.
	Add getFiles and getDependencies methods to PackageDb; implement them
	for RpmPackageDb.   Fix the PATCH_MESSAGE to give the mailing list
	address.

2005-10-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Rewrite. Rename the Config class to _Config, and
	provide a singleton instance named config. It is no longer necessary
	to instantiate a _Config instance in any script, whereas previously it
	was necessary to do so if any values needed to be changed. Also rename
	logdir to logDir, scratch to scratchDir, and data to dataDir. When the
	*Dir values are changed, the new directory is created instantly if it
	does not exist.	NOTE: this is an API change. Updating any scripts
	should be as simple as replacing 'Config' with 'config', 'logdir' with
	'logDir', 'scratch' with 'scratchDir', 'data' with 'dataDir' and
	removing any instantiations of the old Config class. Also, the old way
	of loading configuration values from a file is no longer supported.
	The current preferred method is to create a Python file that contains
	something like: "from dogtail.config import config; config.logDir =
	'../logs/'; config.debugSearching = True" and then import that file
	from whatever scripts need it.

	* dogtail/logging.py, dogtail/tc.py, dogtail/tree.py,
	examples/firefox-test-browsing-local-html-file.py,
	examples/gcalctool-test-fibonacci.py,
	examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py,

	examples/nautilus-test-icon-view-collage.py, examples/data/sample.cfg:
	Update to new config API.

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Update to new config API. Also, change "def
	run(application, arguments = None, appName = None):" to "def
	run(application, arguments = '', appName = ''):".

	* dogtail/utils.py: Update to new config API. Also, make run()'s appName
	argument default to "''" instead of "None", just like
	dogtail.procedural.run(). Also, make run() use doDelay() instead of
	sleep() to get logging for free via the config.config.debugSearching
	option.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Don't break if a filename is passed to
	screenshot().

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py,
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py, setup.py: Post-release version
	bump.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	Released 0.4.3.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Created with major changes since 0.4.2.

	* dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py,
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py, setup.py: Bump version numbers.

	* dogtail.spec, debian/changelog: Add changelog entries for 0.4.3.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* icons/dogtail-head-48.png, icons/dogtail-head.svg,
	icons/dogtail-tail-48.png, icons/dogtail-tail.svg: Add icons.

	* MANIFEST.in, setup.py: Add new icons to distribution.

	* dogtail/logging.py: Make IconLogger use the dogtail-tail icon.

	* sniff/sniff: Use the dogtail-head icon for the application. Use the
	theme's	desktop icon for the root node in the TreeView. If the then
	has an icon for any application displayed in the TreeView, use it.

	* sniff/sniff.desktop: Use the dogtail-head icon in the menu.

	* dogtail/trayicon.py: Fix typo.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Implement the FocusError exception properly.

2005-10-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/trayicon.py: Instead of totally bailing out if Python is
	older than 2.4, just make TrayIcon useless, as is currently the case
	if TrayIcon._runZenity() fails. What should really happen is for
	TrayIcon to actually work under older Python versions, I think.

2005-10-20  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/epiphany.py: Use the package name
	'epiphany-browser' on Debian-based distributions. Thanks to Andrew
	Beresford for the patch.

2005-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec, setup.py, debian/changelog, debian/copyright: Correct
	website URL.

2005-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/icons: Create directory.

	* sniff/*.xpm, sniff/icons/*.xpm: Move icons.

	* MANIFEST.in, setup.py, sniff/sniff: Update the icon locations.

2005-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: Add sniff/*.xpm.

2005-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add table() and tableCell() to Action and
	FocusWidget. Allow run() to use utils.run()'s optional 'appName'
	argument, for cases where the application's name is different from the
	binary's name.

2005-10-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/yelp.py: new file, wrapper for Yelp.

2005-10-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/predicate.py: add IsATabNamed class

	* dogtail/tree.py: add Node.tab() method

	method; add AppointmentWindow and MeetingWindow subclasses

2005-10-14  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: Refactor createAccount, add
	functions to run the first-time wizard (sharing code with account
	creation). Add a blowAwayEvolution function

	* examples/evolution-test-first-time-wizard.py: New example, testing
	the above. Blows away your evolution configuration, so use with
	caution...

2005-10-14  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: Fix wrapper so that it does not
	require a window, in preparation for wrapping the first-time assistant.

2005-10-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/trayicon.py: Added from jhbuild's jhbuild/utils/.

	* dogtail/logging.py: Add IconLogger class, a stripped-down version of
	jhbuild's TerminalBuildScript in jhbuild/frontends/terminal.py. Modify
	the DebugLogger class to additionally write messages to the
	IconLogger's tooltip. If zenity is not installed or not working
	properly, the DebugLogger should work exactly as before.

2005-10-13  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/no-help-at-all.py: script which generates parodies of bad
	end-user documentation by simply converting reading the UI back in
	DocBook form.

2005-10-12  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/gedit.py: Initial version, taken from Paolo
	Borelli's home page.

2005-10-11  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Replaced a stray reference to "Search" with
	"Predicate"

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: rename open() to openItem() to avoid
	namespace collision.

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Ignore errors when restoring
	~/.xinitrc. If there was no previous ~/.xinitrc, make sure the
	temporary one isn't left behind. Increase hardcoded sleep delay.

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: Add scripts/ to tarball distribution.

	* setup.py: Install scripts/* .

	* setup.cfg: Add xorg-x11-Xvfb to requires for RPMs.

	* Makefile: Make 'deb' target run 'fakeroot debian/rules clean' before
	building a package.

	* debian/control: Add xvfb to Recommends for debs.

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Correct typo.

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Restore the original ~/.xinitrc after
	the X server terminates.

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add focus.desktop (just a copy of tree.root).
	Later, I'll probably want to replace it with a FocusDesktop instance,
	but for now it's really just to make FocusApplication not break as
	horribly when there are no applications running.

	* scripts/: Created to hold scripts to be installed into /usr/bin/.

	* scripts/dogtail-detect-session: Add a script to detect if an
	accessibility-enabled session is currently running. Right now it
	obviously only looks for a GNOME session, but KDE support can be added
	when available.

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Add a script to run a given dogtail
	script in a headless setup. Currently launches a minimalistic GNOME
	"session" under Xvfb, calls dogtail-detect-session, and if a session
	is detected, executes the dogtail script. Once the script terminates,
	so does the X server - Boom! Closes: #318537

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add Focus.icon(). Add open() for opening
	icons on nautilus' desktop.

2005-10-10  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Move initial expansion from main to resetModel, so that
	we get the sane one-deep expansion on a Refresh, as well as when sniff
	starts.

2005-10-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/filechooser-stress-test.py: Port to procedural API.

2005-10-10  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/filechooser-stress-test.py: New file: repeatedly open and
	close the filechooser, for testing perfomance/profiling

2005-10-09  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/gcalctool-test-fibonacci.py: New file: another test
	example. Drives gcalctool to calculate the Fibonacci series.

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/gcalctool.py: New file: wrapper to help when
	writing gcalctool tests

2005-10-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py: Include sniff/*.xpm in the distribution.

	* sniff/sniff: modify loadIcon() to first search the current
	directory, then /usr/share/dogtail/icons. If distributions need to put
	them elsewhere, we can certainly accommodate them.

2005-10-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Revert API change - rename Action.doThisAction() to
	Action.do(). Add documentation in Node.__getattr__(), the only place
	it is used, to make it clear what is happening.

2005-10-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff.glade: Give the TreeView default focus.
	Really remove the Edit menu.

2005-10-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Add Dave as an author.
	Correct the website URL and remove the License button in the About box.
	Remove 'Role name and 'Description' fields from the TreeView.
	Change the packing on the TreeView to disable expanding.
	Stop importing pdb without using it.

	* sniff/sniff.glade: Change the 'Snoop' menu item name to 'Sniff' -
	sniff used to be called snoop.
	Add keyboard shortcuts to all menu items.
	Remove Edit menu.

2005-10-09  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: added role attribute to Node (forgot to commit this
	earlier)

2005-10-09  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/button.xpm, sniff/checkbutton.xpm, sniff/checkmenuitem.xpm,
	sniff/colorselection.xpm, sniff/combo.xpm, sniff/dialog.xpm,
	sniff/image.xpm, sniff/label.xpm, sniff/menubar.xpm,

	sniff/unknown.xpm, sniff/viewport.xpm, sniff/vscrollbar.xpm,
	sniff/vseparator.xpm, sniff/window.xpm: Add icons, copied from at-poke

	* sniff/sniff: add constants to represent the tree model columns; use
	icons for nodes, based on code in at-poke. Requires up-to-date pyspi
	(for the role attribute)

2005-10-08  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/recorder.py: Fix the imports so this works again.

2005-10-08  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/evolution-test-switching-components.py: New example which
	repeatedly cycles through Evolution's components.

2005-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Expand the root node of the TreeView on startup.

2005-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec: Added, from Jeremy Katz.

	* MANIFEST.in: Add dogtail.spec.

	* Makefile: Rework 'rpm' target to call the 'tarball' target first,
	then build the rpm using dogtail.spec, using sudo if necessary. Also,
	make the 'tarball' target call the 'clean' target.

2005-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/google-search.py: Fix call to findChildren(). Fix reference
	to predicate.GenericPredicate.

2005-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>
	* examples/firefox-test-browsing-local-html-file.py,
	examples/gnome-panel-test-starting-every-app.py,
	examples/google-search.py,

	support. Closes: #318225

2005-10-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* ChangeLog: Add history since import, tweak formatting. Also add
	commit times (maybe we don't actually want them though, I'm not sure I
	care).

2005-10-07  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-tree-api.py: Fix the example against
	changes to the API.

2005-10-07  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Provide a better warning for when import wnck
	fails (it's a warning, not an error). Make Root.application() return
	an Application instance, rather than a mere Node.

	* ChangeLog: Created.

2005-10-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Minor indentation fix.
