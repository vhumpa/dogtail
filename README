dogtail is a GUI test tool and automation framework written in Python. It uses Accessibility (a11y) technologies to communicate with desktop applications. dogtail scripts are written in Python and executed like any other Python program.

Installation
============

Check your distro for packages! If not at the latest version, we also have
relased tarballs for download: https://gitlab.com/dogtail/dogtail/tree/released

For details see INSTALL file.

Dependencies
============

Python bindings for your distribution, e.g. python-apt or rpm-python

PyGObject and GNOME-Python

Applications to test, e.g. from the GNOME desktop:
    http://gnome.org/

Xvfb and xinit:
    http://xorg.freedesktop.org/

Using
=====

Currently GNOME and GTK+ applications are supported. Thanks to qt-at-spi
KDE4 and QT applications are now available too.

First, enable accessibility support in your GNOME session with:
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface toolkit-accessibility true
This only affects newly-started applications, so you may want to log out and
log back in again.

Important: Handling GTK4 Application Windows in Dogtail

For GTK4 applications, disabling window shadows is essential to ensure accurate positioning by Dogtail. With shadows disabled, we encounters a consistent coordinate offset, which we've preconfigured as `dogtail.config.gtk4Offset`. In case of working with fullscreen windows, the offset is 0, and we manage to detect that
on-the-fly both in x11 and wayland sessions. However this process requires `python-xlib`, even for Wayland sessions, leveraging Xwayland to ascertain resolution information, as no more direct method we've found currently available for Wayland.

When window shadows are active, the perceived offset can vary significantly, influenced by factors such as the specific application, window size, and scaling settings. To ensure consistent behavior across applications, disabling shadows is recommended.

Disabling Shadows in GTK4:

To disable window shadows, add the following CSS to your GTK4 configuration (`~/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css`):

window, .popover, .tooltip {
    box-shadow: none;
}

Then, look at some of the example scripts. Run them, tweak them, write your own.

I suggest starting with gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py, as it's updated the
most often.

If you are using KDE instead, install the 'qt-at-spi' QT plugin and make sure
you QT_ACCESSIBILITY set to 1 throughout your environment (you can put
'export QT_ACCESSIBILITY=1' to your profile file). QT accessibility should
be stable from QT 4.8.3 onward.
